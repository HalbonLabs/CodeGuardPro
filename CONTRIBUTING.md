## Adding New Tools

To add a new quality tool:

1. **Add the tool to `QualityHubProvider.ts`**:

   ```typescript
   {
     name: "Tool Display Name",
     actualTool: "actual-tool-name",
     description: "What the tool does",
     icon: "vscode-icon-name",
     command: "quality-hub.newTool",
     category: "Appropriate Category"
   }
   ```

2. **Add command to `package.json`**:

   ```json
   {
     "command": "quality-hub.newTool",
     "title": "Tool Display Name",
     "category": "CodeGuard Pro",
     "icon": "$(icon-name)"
   }
   ```

3. **Implement the command in `extension.ts`**:

   ```typescript
   vscode.commands.registerCommand("quality-hub.newTool", () =>
     handleNewTool(qualityService),
   );
   ```

4. **Add the tool logic to `QualityToolsService.ts`**
